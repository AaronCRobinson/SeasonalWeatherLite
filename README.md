# Seasonal Weather Lite

[![RimWorld Alpha 17](https://img.shields.io/badge/RimWorld-Alpha%2017-brightgreen.svg)](http://rimworldgame.com/)

Extends weather to change based on season. Includes only vanilla weather.

## Features
- Each season has different weather commonalities for each weather type
- All biomes have weather adapted a bit to fit each season. More to come.
- Most biomes are less clear now and I think Jungles in particular will go more in this direction.
